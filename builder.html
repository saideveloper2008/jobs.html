    <h1 class="sai"> BUILDER </h1>
    <p class="dash">  The top builders in India are taking the real estate sector to a whole new level, and considering the rise in population which increases the need for a living space or for doing business. The real estate sector in India aids in the country’s economy significantly as there are constant demands from clients, which consist of both individuals and businesses.

        In every town and city across India, one can find a real estate builder that will take on the job of building your dream home, a shop or even a commercial infrastructure. So, whether you are planning to build a house for your family, or maybe you want to build one or more apartments and rent out to tenants, or you want to build a shop for business, etc., you’re going to need to approach a builder for that.
        
        Hiring a Real Estate Builder Near You
        
        If we talk about building residential buildings or shops in any sub-urban and urban region, getting in touch with a local builder isn’t going to be difficult, since there are many and they are readily available for hire.
        
        However, the challenge that most people face is their costs – architect’s cost, labour wage per day, and additional costs that are required for purchasing building items and accessories (which are, of course, many on the list).

         <p class="dash">ATS Infrastructure is an emerging new response to the growing need for quality housing and residential real estate development, specifically in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) which comprise regions within Noida (Uttar Pradesh) and Gurugram (Haryana), respectively.
        
        The ATS homes offer its residents an exclusive living experience with lush green surroundings, modern architecture, world-class amenities and a host of convenient facilities.
        
        
        ATS has come a long way setting new benchmarks in the real estate development sector. With a myriad of world-class projects under its name, the company has attained recognition in the real estate industry for its unprecedented standards in architecture, design and aesthetics.  </p>
    <h1 class="pico" id="EB">   Education for builders</h1>
    <p class="dash"> Schools buildings have particular design requirements in terms of spatial planning and flexible use of space, control of vibrations and acoustics, and robustness. Class room sizes are specified in Department for Education Building Bulletins, along with requirements for other larger spaces such as specialist rooms and sports facilities.

        In the higher educational sector, the form of construction is typically academic buildings consisting of offices, lecture theatres, classrooms and laboratories, and multi-storey student residences consisting of multiple bedrooms.
        
        Key requirements for educational buildings are fast construction programmes so that new buildings can be completed within one academic year, or even three months of the summer vacation in the case of building extensions, and also the flexible use of space to meet current and future educational needs.
        
        Steel construction has achieved a strong market share in all types of educational buildings for the above reasons. Modular construction has become the dominant form of construction for larger student residences, particularly for metropolitan universities. Shallow floor solutions have found a niche in this sector because of their superior vibration and acoustic performance, and the ability to reconfigure the internal space by re-locating internal light steel walls. </p>
          
        <h1>Attributes of steel construction </h1>
        <p class="dash">Modern educational buildings are required to achieve strict performance targets, such as acoustic, thermal or ventilation requirements and also must provide flexible spaces to suit a variety of uses. There is also a need to consider how the buildings can be adapted and reconfigured to meet future educational needs. Emphasis is placed on pupil and staff satisfaction, the studying environment as well as community involvement. Therefore robust, safe and good environmental performance are also important requirements.

            Often the construction of new academic, residential and sports buildings is carried out in close proximity to other functioning buildings and therefore minimising noise, deliveries, vibration and other sources of disturbance is important to the choice of structural system. The time available for construction of new buildings is often very short, typically just 14 months for university buildings and 12 months for school buildings, and the cycle is geared towards building completion ready for the start of the academic year allowing time for handover and final fit out. This means that speed of construction, often including a high proportion of off-site manufacture, is a key requirement for education buildings. Speed and off-site manufacture are important attributes of steel construction.
            
            Steel construction is able to address all these aspects and is routinely used to deliver cost effective and sustainable educational buildings. Off-site manufacturing improves safety and construction speed, reduces waste and disturbance, and results in better quality. Modular construction is widely used for the construction of student residences because of its speed of construction, and also because of the economies of scale that can be achieved by manufacture of multiple similar bedroom units.
            
            Attributes of steel construction in the educational sector:
            
            Speed of construction
            
            The use of prefabricated components means that construction periods can conform to the academic year (July of one year to August of the next).
            
            Adaptability and flexibility
            
            Long span steel construction creates column-free space and allows rooms to be configured on the floor plan to meet the current and future educational needs.
            
            Light steel internal walls can be relocated, leading to fully adaptable buildings to meet future needs. </p>

                Safer construction
                
                Health and safety is improved due to increased control over off-site operations, which is important if construction is in parallel with educational activities.
                
                Small foundations
                
                Steel or composite frames are lighter than concrete frames, thus foundation sizes, which may be important in minimising on site activities, are generally smaller.
                
                               P13 Image.jpg
                Large column free areas, such as theatres, are easily constructed with a steel frame
                Aesthetic ‘lightness’
                
                The aesthetics of school and University buildings is important in achieving a creative working atmosphere. Slender members can be designed efficiently, with the use of tubular sections. Ease of forming curved and perforated members adds to the lightness of the structure.</p>
